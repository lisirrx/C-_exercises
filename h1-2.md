## Problem 2 FanZong's Diagram

### Description

FanZong went to Google two months ago.In google,FanZong met a lot of talents just like him.They earn a millon dollars one year so they do have money to burn.They decided to create something interesting.Finally they invented a table called k-special table. The  table n × n is called k-special if the following three conditions are satisfied:

1.every integer from 1 to n^2 appears in the table exactly once;

2.in each row numbers are situated in increasing order;

3.the sum of numbers in the k-th column is maximum possible.

Now FanZong introduce this interesting table to you.Your goal is to find at least one k-special table of size n × n. Both rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n, with rows numbered from top to bottom and columns numbered from left to right.

### INPUT

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the size of the table FanZong is looking for and the column that should have maximum possible sum.

### OUTPUT

First print the sum of the integers in the k-th column of the required table.

Next n lines should contain the description of the table itself: first line should contains n elements of the first row, second line should contain n elements of the second row and so on.

If there are multiple suitable table, you are allowed to print any.           

### SAMPLE INPUT
