## Problem 3 GC's Domino

### Description

Google Camp is coming to recruit new members on this Saturday’s afternoon!There are  numerous fun activities in GC.Domino is one of them.GCers are  very clever and they create a new way to play Domino.

Arrange n dominoes in a line, placing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However, somewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at least one domino pushed in the opposite direction.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.

Given the initial directions of the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process!

### INPUT

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string si is equal to

"L", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;

"R", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;

".", if the i-th domino has not been pushed.

It is guaranteed that if si = sj = "L" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and sk = "R"; if si = sj = "R" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and sk = "L".

### OUTPUT

Output a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.      

### SAMPLE INPUT

``` 
14
.L.R...LR..L..
```

### SAMPLE OUTPUT

``` 
4
```

### Hint

``` 
The example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange.
